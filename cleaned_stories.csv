75,2193,female,23.0,yes,latinx,5756369736,puberty,,,,0,0,0,0,0,"I am the youngest of four siblings. The fact that I was born three months premature, resulted in the diagnosis of Athetoid Spastic Cerebral palsy. Although I am highly independent, I have never been given the proper support to utilize my full capability, independence & potential. Thus, confining me to an electric wheelchair for mobility & caregivers doing everything for me. I have always felt that everyone has treated me like I am incompetent, despite my age. I was abused & neglected by my mother & middle brother for as long as I can remember until the age of eighteen. My mother was periodically absent from my life, because she was incarcerated multiple times throughout my elementary & middle school career for reasons that I still don‚Äôt know. It was during my elementary & high school career that two CPS & one APS case was filled against my mother which were all ruled unsubstantiated, due to the lack of physical evidence, even though my oldest brother & grandmother were aware of the treatment that I received & did nothing. Due to the lack of acceptance, affection, approval, comfort, compassion, grace & love from my family, it was also during my elementary & middle school career that I began having numerous incest relationships with female cousins & three female friends where I first began to question my sexuality, dressed like a tomboy & labeled myself as bisexual. Freshman year of high school these incest relationships ended & I began to get involved in numerous long distance relationships in desperation for acceptance, affection, approval, comfort, compassion, grace & love while avoiding altercations, arguments, confrontations & disagreements because of my trauma. When these relationships did not last, I got involved in six different in person relationships where I was extremely indecisive as to whether or not I should be with these individuals, because of the paralyzing fear of my past repeating itself which prevented any of those relationships from lasting. Although I was extremely adamant about setting myself apart from my family dynamic, alcohol, premarital intercourse & Marijuana is the norm in my family. Therefore, I was persistently pressured to try Marijuana until I finally gave into trying Marijuana once I graduated from high school just to shut my family up. I used Marijuana inconsistently recreationally for awhile. At the age of eighteen, I was finally removed from my mothers home when I experienced suicidal ideations for the very first time & my significant other whom I was with at the time called the authorities asking them to do a welfare check on me. I was placed at my local hospital under an alias until alternative placement was found. Two weeks later, I was taken to my first nursing home where I resided for three months. While there, I ended my relationship with my significant other at the time & transitioned to a group home only staying two weeks because I had slowly started reconnecting with my family on social media & became homesick. Instantly after returning home, I realized that their behavior had not changed, but I had no way to return to the nursing home or group home. Therefore, I remained at home & attempted my first semester in college. While attending college, I befriended one female who was fully aware of my home life. Her & I decided to get an apartment together in attempt to get away from my family. While she remained in college, I dropped out the same semester that I went in, because my home life at the time prevented me from maintaining a reasonable GPA. At this point, I had given up on love & was not looking for a relationship. However, I still had an account with multiple online dating apps. While scrolling through an app one evening, I received a message from a man who was new to my area & homeless after leaving an abusive relationship & attempting to start fresh with another female who he soon found out was not interested in a serious relationship. Him & I spoke for one month on Kik & Facebook Messenger before meeting in person. The more that we got to know one another, he soon became my significant other, I took him off of the street & my roommate moved out. At this time, I was continuing to use marijuana recreationally, but inconsistently. Within a year & a half of our relationship, I lost my virginity to him conceiving our first born son. I stopped using marijuana during my pregnancy & I had a healthy uneventful pregnancy. However, despite our efforts to be as prepared as possible for his arrival with numerous ultrasounds doctors were not prepared for the difference in anatomy when removing my son from my womb. Thus causing me to contract the Sepsis virus & remain hospitalized for twenty eight days while my son was discharged from the hospital accordingly two days after his arrival. We only had our son home for two weeks before a CPS case was opened up against my ex boyfriend on Valentines Day. My ex boyfriend was allegedly accused of emotional & physical abuse as well as unsupervsion of an infant when he expressed that he saw himself throwing my son when he became overwhelmed, but never actually did to a registered nurse who was associated with the Families First Program. During the investigation, my ex boyfriend & I were required to get Psychiatric Evaluations & Counseling Services that later confirmed our diagnoses of Anxiety, Chronic Depression & PTSD allowing me to get my Medical Cannabis License. When I attempted to discuss the results of my psychiatric evaluation with my mother, she stated that my family thinks that I fabricated the story as to how I obtained my mental health illnesses. During this time, my ex boyfriend was told that he was the father of a female child conceived during the two month relationship with the abusive female that caused him to leave his hometown & become homeless. He was ordered to pay child support for & visit her monthly. However, because of his mental health  illnesses that are the result of his upbringing & the incident with our son he was not able to pay child support or visit her. Gratefully, although the child support is court ordered the aunt of his ex girlfriend who has custody of his daughter does not want any type of financial support. All she wanted was for the child to have a relationship with her father, so we began to visit her monthly. My son was transitioned to four different people before my sister was given custody & the case was closed. During this time, my mother was evicted from her apartment due to non payment of rent since she was attempting to support my brothers alcoholism. I agreed to take both of them in under the agreement that no alcohol be consumed under my roof which I learned later was not followed. While my mother & brother were living with me, my mother consistently pressured me into purchasing marijuana for my brother with my license which I did in an attempt to avoid upsetting anyone. Although I had good intentions, housing my mother & brother kept me in a constant trigger continuously reacting. Thus, causing my ex boyfriend & I to break up leading him to leave back to El Paso. However, we continued to communicate during that time & agreed that the reason for the decline in our mental health & relationship was because of the dysfunctional relationship with my family & he agreed to continue working on our relationship as long as I kicked my brother & mother out of my house. One evening while my mother was at my grandmothers & I was left at home with my brother talking to my ex boyfriend on the phone my brother who was intoxicated demanded to use my phone & I said no. He proceeded to take my phone from me while emotionally & verbally abusing me. When I attempted to walk away, my brother blocked the door. While attempting to defend myself from the emotional & verbal abuse of my brother. He forcefully pushed my back into the backrest of my wheelchair causing redness on my chest. My ex boyfriend who was on the other end of the phone during the whole ordeal called the police from El Paso. The police arrested my brother that night, due a warrant that was out for his arrest for failure to pay fines. When my mother finally came home at 6:00 AM the next morning, I told my mother that if she bailed my brother out, that would indicate to me that my brother & his alcoholism would be more important than my safety & well-being which would lead to me never speaking to neither of them again. Although my mother repeatedly apologized for my brothers behavior & promised me that she would not bail him out. My mother bailed my brother out the very next day. After picking up my ex boyfriend from El Paso, I kicked my mother & brother out of my house. At this point, I was consistently attending weekly counseling services. However, after a year & a half of Counseling Services, I stopped attending Counseling, because of all of the bureaucracy within this world. Upon searching for a silver lining in my circumstances, hardships & obstacles I visited two different churches before finding my forever home & family with Real Life Church in my hometown where I was baptized for the very first time. However, despite my efforts to mend our five year relationship our relationship was unquestionably unhealthy which resulted in me leaving my hometown & church behind in order to reside in a second nursing home where I have lived for six months hoping that my ex boyfriend & I  could individually & as couple be restored since we were given the support to solely focus on our relationship rather than attempting to balance a coworker & significant other relationship at the same time. However, since I left he had to return to a normal job which he uses as an excuse to not visit his children & as much capability & potential that I felt our relationship had it unfortunately did not turn out the way that I had hoped permanently ending on Wednesday October 23 2019. As dark as a nursing home may seem or as difficult as it may be for someone my age to be living in a nursing home, I feel that I was brought here to be used as a vessel of Christ as Romans 8:28 states ‚ÄúAll things work together for the good of those who love God & are called according to his purpose‚Äù which has allowed me to remain grateful for every aspect of my testimony that God is continuing to write on my heart, because I am a firm believer in the fact that God works through others & I know that without every aspect of my testimony I would not have found someone who acts as my family more than my biological family within the facility.

It's so bad that I have to use a cane whenever I go to school or any other public place. Because of this, instead of someone seeing me and going ""Hey, there's a girl there! She looks cool!"" they think ""Oh wow, a blind girl!"" I know that it's not my fault, and they're not trying to be mean when they do it. But what they don't seem to get is that besides my vision, I'm pretty normal for the most tarp.; There are lots of other things I have to do differently because of my condition, too. I can't read print, I need to use braille. Special teachers come to my school every day to help me learn. And of course I can't use my iPhone to write this the way you do. I'm using voiceover, a setting that uses text to speech and special gestures. I can do just about anything you would, a lot of apps don't work for me but I've found several good ones that do. But like I said before, I can't see them but I know I'm getting a lot of funny looks because of all this. I think my school is pretty used to me by now, but I'm pretty sure I get a lot of looks when I go out to other places with my family.; Now that I'm in high school, I've started getting used to it. But I remember when I was younger it happened all the time. My mom wanted me to get as much experience in life as possible, so she took me to every park in the general area. Kids would come up to me and try to show me things or ask me to play, but when Mom explained my condition, they all treated me as if I were some kind of alien. I wish I was an alien, then I could fly through space and have all kinds of adventures LOL!; Like I said before I know they're not trying to make me feel this way. The kids at the parks for example, they were so young they probably didn't even know that not being able to see was a thing. That doesn't mean I don't wish they could have treated me a bit more normally.; A lot of the time, I don't even think about my condition. I feel like a normal girl. Then, somebody asks me if I like their sweater, and it all comes rushing back.; I've found ways of avoiding some of it all together, though. Whenever I talk to a new person, I try to start with something that we both understand that doesn't have anything to do with my condition. If we're at lunch for example, I'll ask what they're eating and what their favorite foods are.

How could kids be so ruthless? I honestly didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself.; Eventually a teacher noticed what was going on, and sent me to guidance. I met one of the most amazing people ever, my guidance counselor. For the rest of the year, he was the only person that could get me to calm down...the only person who could get me to talk, and feel better.; So many people judged me that day... but one person surprised me the most. My best friend. He just laughed among all of the other kids. It was like a stab in my little girl heart. The one person I relied on the help me in the situation. And even they abandoned me. We aren‚Äôt friends anymore... he called me crazy and decided he didn‚Äôt want to deal with my crap anymore.

However, I was a bit less than the average weight. I just didn‚Äôt realize this yet. This led to me watching carefully what I was eating and me kind of over obsessing the mirror. I mostly felt insecure about my body type. For example, if I wore a pair of nice jeans, I got several looks from those girls I mentioned. Once in awhile , a few boys and girls in my class would engage in a conversation of whose the thinnest. They would brag and criticize other people. I actually once caught a conversation about me. They had pure looks of disgust and were shaking their heads when one girl asked how thin they think I am. When I got home, I started crying. This wasn‚Äôt the only thing I got bullied for.

My mom decided to move me that following year to a new school.; I don‚Äôt want to say their names, but they were a group of children. You see, my class was quite small, and most of them got their share of bullying me and two other girls (my best friend and another friend ). My relationship to them is very complicated. I avoid them as much as possible, but everybody seems to have a connection with them! I know I can‚Äôt just run away from my problems so, I ignore them. The problem is, my other best friend transferred to that school and she is hanging out with them. She says she doesn‚Äôt like them, but still hangs out with them.

Wherever I fell short, he excelled, and whenever he needed help, I‚Äôd step in.We weren‚Äôt very similar, but that made it better. We complemented the other.; I liked him and he liked me. It was as simple as that. We started wanting different things after the discovery of our feelings for the other. He was manipulative without meaning to be. That was when I started thinking; Oh boy, shit‚Äôs going to hit the fan.; On the surface level, nothing bad. He planned dates, surprised me often, and bought me gifts. I never wanted any of these things, though. Dates got in the way of my schedule, surprises made me anxious, especially ones in the forms of grand gestures, and I refused gifts out of principle. So he‚Äôd guilt trip me. He made me feel bad about not making time for dates. For not enjoying surprises like others do. For refusing gifts. He did things I didn‚Äôt enjoy. Things that made me uncomfortable.; I stopped seeing him. I used to allot an hour a day to drop by his house, to greet his family, and to study for a while before attending to my responsibilities. When he tried stretching that time, when he tried forcing me to stay and ‚Äòenjoy‚Äô his company, I stopped. I was uncomfortable, so I stopped putting myself in that situation.; I knew him, and he knew me. I‚Äôm not sure if either of us know each other anymore. We stopped talking for a year. We talked again for 4 months and 2 weeks through daily phone calls, as I am now in another country, and now we haven‚Äôt spoken in 2 months. I said ‚Äòbye‚Äô to him, and I suppose to the relationship we had as well.

The problem was that he had a girlfriend. They were on again off again, and she treated him like trash. I found myself trying to be there for him a lot, but it was hard to be supportive of the relationship when I liked him so much and she was so obviously not doing him any good. Nonetheless, I had to be, because I'm a good friend and I would never make a move on someone who's taken; Eventually, they broke up for good, and my other friends jumped at the chance to set us up. About 2 months after they broke up, him and 2 of my other friends had a sleepover at my house. We all went out to a park nearby around midnight and sat on an awning above the pond, listening to music and goofing off. He put his arms around me, and it made me feel amazing. Later that night, we all fell asleep in my living room, him and I cuddling on the couch; The next morning, he helped me make breakfast, and asked me to be his girlfriend. I was so excited, and he made me so happy. Not only had he been a great friend, but he had been proving himself to be great boyfriend material ever since he found out I liked him. He helped me cook, listened to my babbling, did the dishes without being asked despite being a guest in my house. We had the same sense of humor, liked doing a lot of the same things. After we became official, he would hang out at my house a lot and we would do homework together, watch TV, etc. ; One day, we sat in my room, organizing my bookshelf, and he asked me to tell him about all my favorite books. He found a picture of a dog that I used as a bookmark, and asked about her- my first best canine friend. Another time, he took the last aussie bite (a weird oatmeal snack that tastes awesome) and ran off, and I chased him all over my apartment complex until we collapsed on the ground laughing. I had an asthma attack, and he ran to my house to get my inhaler, then insisted on carrying me back home because I ""still sounded wheezy""; Once, I said I hadn't had breakfast or lunch, and he went into panic mode and started looking through my kitchen for something to feed me. I remember sitting in his lap when a friend of my brother's made some inappropriate comment and he held me closer and told the person to screw off. There were other times like this, where someone was being innappropriate, and he knew it bothered me so he would put the person in their place; A kid once straight up asked if we had had sex yet, and I made some flippant comment about making him wait, and he looked me straight in the eyes and told me that he was fine with waiting as long as I needed. Eventually though, my anxiety got in the way and I ruined everything. I pushed away the guy that looked at me like I was his whole world, that called me beautiful despite the cringey haircut I had, who loved my affinity for animals, and who never, ever pushed me to do anything I wasn't comfortable with; He ended up breaking up with me after 3 months, because I was so awful to him sometimes. I had thought I could be better for him than his previous girlfriend, but I didn't know how bad my anxiety would get, that I would hurt him too. For a long time, I was able to convince myself that I was okay with the break up. Now, two years later, I can't seem to get him off my mind.

I am a guy and when puberty hit and I started developing as a female I knew something was very wrong. ; Estrogen is the female hormone and it is what causes chest development and curves, thinner body hair, a higher voice, a round face, mood swings, and for most people a very low sex drive. Testosterone is the male hormone and it‚Äôs what causes thick facial and body hair, a prominent jawline, a deep voice, easily agitated, and a high sex drive.; Puberty and estrogen hit me like a truck. I had developed a large chest and a fragile frame. My periods kept me bed ridden from the pain they caused and it was never shorter than 10 days for me. It made me seclude myself and hide from social situations. You could say I was depressed but I see it as distressed.; I came out as transgender after pushing myself to be feminine and to ‚Äúwork through it.‚Äù A bit after that I started testosterone.

# Product Analysis and Initial Recommendations

This is a sample work of a Product Analysis and Initial Recommendations intended to serve as a project for my portfolio.

The intention is to replicate and represent the analysis presented to Real Talk, and capture the impact of that analysis, and how it affected product statgey/priorities going forward.

- Initial EDA and cleaning done in python, and visualized with Tableau
- [slide deck can be found here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mnf4DD0cqGeWD-iSV1_syZfjWEAVttXzc0wUTG8CAjw/edit?usp=sharing) as well as in an pdf format in the repo
